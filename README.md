## Download the entire ambientCG texture library
This repository was created to simplify a repetitive process: downloading textures from ambientCG, extracting them, and manually removing unused images.

With this automation, all textures are pre-downloaded to your computer. Once you find the texture you need on the ambientCG website, you can quickly locate it locally without additional steps.

Hereâ€™s the translation and an explanation of how to use the configuration file:

## Setting Up the Script  

To configure the script, use the `config.yaml` file. Here's an example configuration:  

```yaml
resolution: "1K"                  # (1K, 2K, 4K, 8K)
file_type: "JPG"                  # (JPG/PNG)
downloads_folder: "downloads"
unzip: 
  enabled: true                   # (true/false)
  folder: "unzipped"
keep_files:                       # Files marked as false will be deleted
  color: true
  roughness: true
  normal_gl: true
  normal_dx: true
  metalness: true
  opacity: true
  ambient_occlusion: true
  displacement: false
  cover: false
```

### How to Use It  

1. **Adjust the Settings**  
   - Open the `config.yaml` file in a text editor.  
   - Set the `resolution` to the desired quality (e.g., "1K", "2K").  
   - Choose the `file_type` (either "JPG" or "PNG").  
   - Specify the folder for downloaded textures under `downloads_folder`.  

2. **Configure Unzipping**  
   - If you want the textures to be automatically extracted, set `enabled` to `true`.  
   - Define the folder for unzipped files under `folder`.  

3. **Manage File Types**  
   - In the `keep_files` section, mark the file types you want to keep as `true`.  
   - Any file type set to `false` will be deleted after extraction.  

4. **Run the Script**  
   - Save your changes to the `config.yaml` file.  
   - Execute the script, and it will follow the configuration to download, unzip, and manage the textures automatically.

## Installation  

You can set up the project in two ways: using **Poetry** or a traditional setup with `requirements.txt`. Choose the method that best suits your workflow.  

### Option 1: Using Poetry  
1. Ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.  
   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```
2. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alvarognnzz/ambientcg-downloader
   cd ambientcg-downloader
   ```
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
   ```
4. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   poetry run python main.py
   ```

### Option 2: Without Poetry (using `requirements.txt`)  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alvarognnzz/ambientcg-downloader
   cd ambientcg-downloader
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

Both methods will set up the environment for running the project. If you're new to dependency management, the second option (`requirements.txt`) is more straightforward.
